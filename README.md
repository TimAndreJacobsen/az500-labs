# Key Sections:
## 4-Part Hands-On Plan:

- Part 1: Defender for Cloud ($5-8) - Secure Score, JIT access, vulnerability assessment
- Part 2: Network Security ($8-12) - NSGs, ASGs, Private Endpoints, traffic testing
- Part 3: Azure Sentinel ($5-8) - SIEM, KQL queries, analytics rules, playbooks
- Part 4: Identity & Storage ($5-10) - Conditional Access, Storage security, SQL protection

## Critical Terraform Patterns:

Budget alerts at 80%, 90%, 100%
Auto-shutdown VMs at 10 PM
B1s VMs + Standard_LRS (cheapest options)
Conditional deployment for expensive resources
Common tags for cost tracking

## Cost Safety:

Services to avoid (Azure Firewall: $912/month!)
Emergency teardown scripts
Daily cost checking commands
Target: $0.50-2 per 2-3 hour session


## Study Resources:

Microsoft Learn (free with sandboxes)
YouTube channels for video learning
Practice questions from module assessments
The guide gives you the structure and patterns to build everything yourself. Each part has specific hands-on tasks to complete. Start with the budget module to protect yourself, then dive into Lab 01 - Defender for Cloud!
